# Autonomous-Fleet
School project:  Create a fleet of autonomous vehicle for devilry. The computer is used as a server, the vehicle is controlled by a raspberry PI and an Arduino. This project was done in one week with a team of 4 people. 

The robots are on a grid made of white lines on the ground. Each one has a destination (different or the same) they have to go to. On the way there are obstacles: permanant or temporary. 



server.py has to run on the computer used as a server
robot.py has to run on the Raspberry boards. We tested up to 2 robots at the same time
slave.ino has to run on the Arduino boards.

At the end of the week, we did a competition with all the teams of the class and we were the 1st.
